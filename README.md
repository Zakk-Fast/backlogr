# Backlogr

Backlogr is a mobile-first game backlog manager built with React, TypeScript, and SCSS. It allows users to search for games via the IGDB API, add them to a swipeable card-based library, and track their progress using custom statuses like "Backlog", "Playing", "Completed", and "Dropped".

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- SCSS
- Zustand (for state management)
