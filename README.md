### ðŸŽ® Backlogr

Track your gaming backlog, swipe-style.

Backlogr is a mobile-friendly web app for managing your personal game library. Add games, organize them by status, and swipe through your collection one card at a time. Built for simplicity and joy â€” no logins, no bloat.

### Why It Exists
